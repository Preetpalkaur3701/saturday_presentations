*3D model of the table in FreeCAD*
===================================

----

Let's start

1. Switch to part workbench.
2. Start recording from macro.

----

To make program

1. Open your macro recording in editor(sublime, vim, etc.)
2. Read the code carefully. 
3. Remove all the unwanted lines from the code. 

----

Unwanted lines:
================
Sometimes, in FreeCAD, we change the position of the object again and again to get its final position, all the placements are written in the recording. So, these are the unwanted lines, which is not useful for us. 

----

4. After that, our code is very large. Now, its your choice to minimize it or remain as it is.
5. Copy your code and paste it in python console.
6. After performing all these step, you will get your 3D model of the table.

Thank you :)
